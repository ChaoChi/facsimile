<summary>Non-negative measurement unit family abstract base class.</summary>

<remarks>This class represents the concept of a family of measurement units
whose standard unit values cannot be negative; each derived class represents a
specific family (such as time units, mass units, etc.).  Each derived class
instance represents a specific measurement unit within its family.  For
example, a kilogram measurement unit would be represented by an instance of the
<see cref="MassUnit" /> class, which is a subclass of <see
cref="NonNegativeMeasurementUnit" />.
