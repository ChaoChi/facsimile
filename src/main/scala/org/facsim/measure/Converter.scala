/**
Trait for unit of measurement value conversion.

Converter implementations support the conversion of measurement quantity values
between different measurement units of the same type.  For example, converting
a ''time'' expressed in ''hours'' to a time expressed in ''seconds''.

More specifically, each converter instance is associated with a specific
measurement unit.  They support the conversion of values between this
associated measurement unit and the standard $SI units for the associated type
of measurement.

Refer to [[measure.UnitOfMeasure UnitOfMeasure]] for further information.
