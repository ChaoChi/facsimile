/**
$FACSIMILE simulation measurement elements.

The ''org.facsim.facsimile.measure'' package contains elements for measuring a
variety of physical quantities, such as ''time'', ''mass'', ''length'',
''angle'', ''temperature'', ''linear velocity'', etc. in the user's preferred
units.

@todo Expand on $FACSIMILE's use of units.  $FACSIMILE allows users to use one
or more measurement units, as they see fit, rather than being forced to adopt a
single unit of measure (say seconds for time, inches for length, etc.).  Since
all measurements are stored internally in SI units, no matter which units are
employed by the user, there are never conversion issues when merging models
that use different units.

@todo Expand on $FACSIMILE's use of types for each measurement quantity.
Instead of using a Double, like other simulation systems, $FACSIMILE uses
different types for each measurement quantity.  Consequently, it's not possible
to confuse a distance with a time, or a linear velocity with an angular
velocity, or a mass with a temperature.  By employing an appropriate set of
operators, mechanics formulae can be accommodated by $FACSIMILE in a very
natural way.  By ensuring data ranges are valid (no negative times or masses),
$FACSIMILE ensures data integrity throughout all runs.
