# Java message bundle properties file for the org.facsim.facsimile.* packages.
#
# Exception message strings are prefixed by the package name (minus the
# redundant "org.facsim.facsimile." prefix), followed by a period, followed by
# the exception class name without the redundant "Exception" suffix.
# Consequently, the "org.facsim.facsimile.package.SomeExampleException"
# exception class will have a message string named "package.SomeExample".
#
# For the syntax of this file, refer to:
