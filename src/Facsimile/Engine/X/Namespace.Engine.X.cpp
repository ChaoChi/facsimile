/**
\namespace Facsimile::Engine::X
All %Facsimile library simulation engine exception elements.

The Facsimile::Engine::X namespace stores exception elements that are thrown by
simulation engine elements.

\remarks Non-exception simulation engine elements are stored within the
Facsimile::Engine namespace.

\note This namespace is reserved solely for official %Facsimile project
elements.  It is recommended that you do not place your own simulation code
within this namespace to eliminate the possibility of naming conflicts with
later releases.

\internal Only exception classes and elements relating to the simulation engine
should be included here.  To facilitate new users learning the software, please
try to keep this namespace as uncluttered and as straightforward as possible.
