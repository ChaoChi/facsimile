<summary>Generic abstract base class for state objects.</summary>

<remarks>A "state object" is one that encapsulates the internal state of an
associated <typeparamref name="FinalContext" /> object, called a "state
context" object; the state context object can delegate some of its behaviour to
its associated state objects.

<para>This class supports derived state classes that implement the "State"
design pattern's "State" role.  Refer to Gamma, et al: "Design Patterns:
Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", Addison-Wesley, for further
information.</para>

<para>If an operation is invalid for a specific base class, then that operation
should throw the <see cref="System.InvalidOperationException" /> exception, or
an exception derived from this class.</para></remarks>

<example>For an example of how to use this class, refer to the <see
cref="StateContext {FinalContext, BaseContext}" /> class
documentation.</example>

<typeparam name="FinalContext">The <see cref="StateContext {FinalContext,
BaseState}" />-derived type that represents the associated actual state context
class (or the polymorphic base class of the actual state context
class).</typeparam>

<typeparam name="BaseState">The State-derived base class defining the set of
available states for the associated <typeparamref name="FinalContext" /> type;
all classes derived from this base class are suitable state classes for the
associated state context class.</typeparam>
