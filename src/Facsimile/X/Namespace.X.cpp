/**
\namespace Facsimile::X
All %Facsimile library basic exception elements.

The Facsimile::X namespace stores basic exception elements that have general
application; they are typically used throughout the library as well as within
user code.

\remarks Basic non-exception elements are stored within the Facsimile namespace.

\note This namespace is reserved solely for official %Facsimile project
elements.  It is recommended that you do not place your own simulation code
within this namespace to eliminate the possibility of naming conflicts with
later releases.

\internal Only exception classes and elements that have general application
throughout the library should be included here.  This typically includes
exception base classes and exceptions thrown by basic elements.  To facilitate
new users learning the software, please try to keep this namespace as
uncluttered and as straightforward as possible.
