Test class to verify a type's conformance to the <em>equals contract</em>.

This class contains a single function that verifies whether a class's
overridden {@link java.lang.Object#equals(Object) equals(Object)} method
fulfills the terms of the <em>equals contract</em> - the definition of what it
means for two instances to be considered <em>equal</em>.  The <em>equals
contract</em> is defined by the documentation for the {@link
java.lang.Object#equals(Object) equals(Object)} method.

Since classes that override their equals(Object) method should also override
their {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode() hashCode()} method, so that equal
objects have the same hash codes, hash code tests are also conducted.

/**
Tests the supplied arguments to verify that the terms of the <em>equals
contract</em> are being adhered to by the corresponding object type. 

If the class overrides the {@link java.lang.Comparable#compareTo(Object)
compareTo(Object)} method, then it should be tested for conformance to the
<em>compareTo contract</em>, which includes testing it for conformance to the
<em>equals contract</em>.  Refer to
{@link org.facsim.simtest.javalang.CompareToContract#testConformance
(Comparable, Comparable, Comparable, Comparable)
CompareToContract#testConformance(Comparable, Comparable, Comparable,
Comparable)} for further information.

@param <T> The non-primitive type whose overridden {@link
java.lang.Object#equals(Object) equals(Object)} method is to be tested for
adherence to the <em>equals contract</em>.  All arguments to this procedure
must be of this same type.

@param primary Instance that should test as equal to equalToPrimary by virtue
of their identical contents.  Both primary and equalToPrimary should be
instances of the same class, should compare as equal and should have identical
hash codes.  primary and equalToPrimary should not be references to the same
object.

@param equalToPrimary Instance that should test as equal to primary by virtue
of their identical contents.  Both primary and equalToPrimary should be
instances of the same class, should compare as equal and should have identical
hash codes.  primary and equalToPrimary should not be references to the same
object.

@param notEqualToPrimary Instance that should test as not equal to both primary
and equalToPrimary by virtue of its contents not being identical to the
contents of primary and equalToPrimary alone.  This should be an instance of
the same class as both primary and equalToPrimary, but should not compare equal
to either.  It's hash code can be the same as the hash code of both primary and
equalToPrimary (although, if the hashing function is good, the chances of a
match, statistically, should be extremely low).

Strictly speaking, the equals contract has no conditions regarding the types of
the objects being compared for equality.  However, it's an obvious requirement
that you can only compare like with like, so there should be some consideration
of the types involved.  Two objects with dissimilar types ought not to compare
equal.  The symmetric condition dictates that if one object compares not equal
to a dissimilar object, then the dissimilar object should likewise compare not
equal to the first object.  This implies that the standard behavior for all
overridden equals methods is to reject comparisons with dissimilar objects.

Alas, the waters are muddied, both by inheritance and by Java's "type erasure"
feature.  If two different instances share a common super class, and the
overridden equals method was implemented at the level of that inheritance tree,
then they can be legitimately compared as equal, otherwise they cannot.  As a
result of "type erasure" we cannot be too specific about the types involved.
This test assumes that the types being tested are not java.lang.Integer
instances.

If badType's class fails to fulfill the equals contract correctly, then
these tests may fail.
