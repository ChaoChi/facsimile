<p>Test class to verify a type's conformance to the <em>compareTo
contract</em>.</p>

<p>This class contains a single function that verifies whether a class's
overridden {@link java.lang.Comparable#compareTo(Object) compareTo(Object)}
method fulfills the terms of the <em>compareTo contract</em> - the definition
of what it means for two instances to be ranked by a comparison of their
contents.  The <em>compareTo contract</em> is defined by the documentation for
the {@link java.lang.Comparable#compareTo(Object) compareTo(Object)}
method.</p>

<p>Since classes that override their equals(Object) method should also override
their {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode() hashCode()} method, so that equal
objects have the same hash codes, hash code tests are also conducted.</p>

@see java.lang.Object#equals(Object)
