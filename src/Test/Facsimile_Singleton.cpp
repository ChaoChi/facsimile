influenced by many apparently random issues (number and states of processes
running, number and states of processors/cores, compiler used, etc.).  Failures
are almost certainly indicative of a fault, however.  The point is, we can
prove that it doesn't work (if we ever see a failure), but we can't prove that
it does work (never having seen a failure does not mean it works).
