  <name>Facsimile Simulation/Emulation Library</name>
  <description>
    The Facsimile Simulation/Emulation Scala library for the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM) platform.
    
    libfacsimile is the component of the Facsimile Simulation Suite with which
    user-written simulation models are developed.  It provides a simulation
    engine (providing event definition, scheduling and dispatching support),
    random number streams and statistical distribution sampling facilities,
    statistics collation and reporting facilities, simulation element support,
    3D animations, simulation experiment configuration tools and many other
    simulation-model-related utilities.
