/**
Abstract base class for all measurement types.

Each subclass represents a single _measurement type_ - a physical quantity such
as _time_, _distance_, _velocity_, etc.

Each type supports one or more units of measure.  For example, time quantities
may be measured in _seconds_, _minutes_, _hours_, etc.  These units are
represented by instances of the implementing measurement type's class.  For
each measurement type, there is a standard unit of measure defined by the
_[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units International
System of Units]_ - commonly abbreviated as _SI_.

These standard units are used by _Facsimile_ internally to store measurement
quantities.  (Measurement quantities are stored as immutable instances of
[measure.Measure Measure] subclasses, with each subclass corresponding to each
measurement type.)  For example, the _SI_ standard unit of measure for _time_
is the _second_; consequently, _Facsimile_ stores and calculates all time
quantities in _seconds_ also.  Adoption of the _SI_ standard units simplifies
the implementation of physics calculations within _Facsimile_ and provides a
clearly-defined basis for developing simulation models of the real-world.
(Many other simulation modeling tools suffer from unit of measure confusion,
both internally and externally, creating a wide variety of problems.)

However, it is unreasonable to expect that _Facsimile_ users would be
comfortable entering and reviewing data solely in these units.  For instance,
the _SI_ standard unit of measure for _angles_ is the _radian_ - and there are
few people who don't find the _degree_ a far more intuitive alternative.
Similarly, users in the United States might prefer to use feet & inches,
pounds, Fahrenheit, etc. instead of their metric equivalents.  Consequently,
_Facsimile_ allows users to work with whichever units they - or their customers
or employers - prefer.  _Facsimile_ converts values to the standard _SI_ units
on input and converts them to the required units on output.

@param nameSingular Singular form of the unit name.  This name should be in the
closest match to the user's preferred locale.

@param namePlural Plural form of the unit name.  This name should be in the
closest match to the user's preferred locale.

@param symbol Symbol for this unit.  This name should be in the closest match
to the user's preferred locale.
