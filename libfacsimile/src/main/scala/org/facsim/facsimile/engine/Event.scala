/**
Abstract base class for all _Facsimile_ simulation events.

Events are scheduled for dispatch during construction.

@constructor Create and schedule event to be dispatched after the specified
delay, with the specified priority.

@param delay Delay, measured relative to the current time, after which the
event should be dispatched.  Events will be dispatched in order of their due
time.

@param priority Event's relative priority.  The lower this value, the higher
the priority of the event.  If two events are scheduled for dispatch at the
same due time, the event with the lower priority value be dispatched first.  If
two events are scheduled for dispatch at the same due time, with the same
priority, then the events will be dispatched in the order in which they were
scheduled.

/*
Schedule this event for dispatch.

TODO: I'm really not sure about this.  Here's some arguments against it:
1.  Creation of test events is not possible.  The events have to be dispatched
    at some point by the event queue.  If events are not scheduled
    automatically, then they can be discarded.
2.  If an exception occurs during construction of a sub-class, a pointer to an
    unconstructed event will be retained in the event queue.  This has some
    complex side-effects.

On the other hand, if we don't schedule events during construction, there's
always a chance that the user will forget to do so.  We then also have to worry
more about the state of the event (unscheduled, scheduled, descheduled, done)
and about the freshness of the data (due, priority, etc.).

One idea is to make Event a private final class (rather than a public abstract
class) that takes a payload method argukent, which is executed when the event
is dispatched.  This would allow Event to be hidden away under the surface,
created and accessed solely by the Simulation object's schedule method.  This
would simplify the interface dramatically, and maybe make better use of Scala's
functional capabilities.
