$facsimile library message resource bundle.

Resource bundle containing internationalized text messages suitable for
output.

Create the resource bundle.  The locale of the bundle defaults to the JVM's
default locale; if a locale-specific resource bundle matching the default
locale is available, then it will be loaded - otherwise, the "en_US" (United
States English) resource bundle will be loaded.

Note: A MissingResourceException may be thrown if the resource bundle cannot be
located.  Since the resource is part of the same jar file as the rest of
Facsimile, this should never fail; consequently, we should not attempt to
handle this exception and should allow the exception to terminate the
application.

Retrieve and format a locale-specific string resource.

Retrieves the string resource corresponding to the supplied key from the
$facsimile resource bundle.  Optional arguments are used to format the
resulting string, which will be in the locale that best matches the user's
preference.

@param key Key used to identify the string resource to be retrieved.

@param arguments Arguments to be merged into, and formatted as part of, the
resulting string resource.

@return Locale-specific, formatted version of the requested string resource.

@throws java.lang.NullPointerException if supplied key is null.

@throws java.util.MissingResourceException if there is no string resource
indexed by the supplied key.

@throws java.lang.ClassCastException if the resource indexed by the supplied
key is not a string.

@throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if the arguments supplied do not
mesh with the formatting encoded within the retrieved string resource.
