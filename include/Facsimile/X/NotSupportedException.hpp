/**
Abstract base class for all %Facsimile library unsupported feature exceptions.

This type of exception will be thrown if a specific application of a feature is
not supported by the %Facsimile library.

\remarks Unsupported feature exceptions should generally not be caught by
exception handling code.  Instead, it is preferable to highlight the error by
allowing such exceptions to terminate the application, so that the root cause
can be identified and fixed.  Unsupported feature exceptions should not be
thrown by a well-behaved application.  Note that the %Facsimile test suite must
catch unsupported feature exceptions in order to validate that they are thrown
appropriately.
