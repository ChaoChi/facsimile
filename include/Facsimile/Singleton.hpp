/**
%Singleton template abstract base class.

This is a helper class that provides thread-safe support for
<em>singletons</em>, sub-classes that implement the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern"><em>%Singleton</em>
design pattern</a>.  Refer to Gamma, et al, <em>Design Patterns: Elements of
Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>, Addison Wesley.

The primary feature of a singleton is that only a single instance may be
created.

\remarks The single instance is accessed, either publicly or otherwise, via the
getInstance() static member function.  This single instance is created using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization"><em>lazy
initialization</em></a>, meaning that it is created and initialized only when
getInstance() is first called.  If no calls to getInstance() are made, the
single instance is never created.  Once created, this instance lasts throughout
the owning application's lifespan.

\par
Attempts to create instances manually, either on the stack or via the
<code><strong>new</strong></code> operator, will fail with the constructor
throwing an exception in such circumstances.

\tparam T The singleton type required.  This type must be both a sub-class of
Facsimile::Singleton (the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_Recurring_Template_Pattern"
><em>Curiously Recurring Template</em> design pattern</a> is employed) and must
also be default constructible; these traits are verified during template
instantiation.

\see getInstance()

\see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton Design
Pattern</a>.

\see <a ref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_Recurring_Template_Pattern"
>Curiously Recurring Template Pattern</a>.

\see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization">Lazy
Initialization</a>.

\internal
Lazy initialization is employed because of potential problems with the general
use of <em>eager initialization</em> (where the instance is created statically
at compile and/or link time).

\par
In case of eager initialization, the sole singleton instance will be created
during code start-up, before the <code>main ()</code> function is called.  The
primary advantage of this method is that singleton creation is thread-safe.
However, the order in which potentially dependent singletons are initialized
cannot be guaranteed, leading to dependency problems.

\par
At the same time, lazy initialization has its problems too: since the C++
language definition does not account for multiple threads of execution, the
double-checked locking pattern (used commonly to implement lazy initialization
in other programming languages) does not work reliably in C++.  Refer to Meyers
and Alexandrescu's revised <a href="http://www.ddj.com/">Dr. Dobbs Journal</a>
article <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/Papers/DDJ_Jul_Aug_2004_revised.pdf"
><em>C++ and the Perils of Double-Checked Locking</em></a>.

We've attempted to resolve these issues using an approach that involves the use
of getter functions.  The downside is that this adds an extra level of
indirection when referencing singleton data through getInstance() and therefore
reduces efficiency very slightly.  The upside is that it should help to
overcome the execution order and cache coherency isses.  Refer to getInstance()
for further information.
