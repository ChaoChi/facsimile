\section collector Automated Garbage Collection
The %Facsimile library provides <em>automated garbage collection</em>
facilities to both simplify the coding of simulation models and to eliminate
<em>memory leaks</em>.  An automated garbage collector, henceforth referred to
simply as a <em>collector</em>, is a system for managing dyanamically-allocated
memory.  The collector is able to identify memory that is no longer referenced,
termed <em>inaccessible</em> memory, and automatically release it.  This frees
the programmer from the complexities and chores of memory management.

To take advantage of this feature, your classes must be derived from
Facsimile::Collectable, or one of its sub-classes.  All %Facsimile classes are
Facsimile::Collectable sub-classes .

There are two primary problems with manual memory management:
-# Freeing memory that is still referenced in your program.  When the freed
memory is subsequently accessed, by code that thinks the memory is still
available, application crashes become likely.
-# Failing to free memory that is no longer referenced.  Memory that is not
freed ties up precious memory resources.  This is a particular problem for
simulations that can be expected to run for days at a time, since memory leaks
will reduce the amount of memory available (not just to the simulation, but to
the entire system) until memory exhaustion occurs.  This class of problem is
termed a <em>memory leak</em>.

\see Facsimile::Collectable

\internal
The %Facsimile library provides replacements for the global C++
<code><strong>new</strong></code> and <code><strong>delete</strong></code>
operators (defined within the Collectable.cpp source file).  There are a number
of reasons why these replacement operators are required:

-# The <em>Boehm-Demers-Weiser</em> collector allocates memory in heaps that it
controls, so that it can scan them for pointers to inaccessible collectable
resources.  If pointers to collectable resources are stored in other heaps
(such as that provided by the default C++ global
<code><strong>new</strong></code> operator, or by the C <code>malloc
(size_t)</code> function - both of which are outside the control of the
collector), then the collector, being unable to scan such memory, may decide
that a collectable resource is inaccessible when it is still referenced within
the non-collector heap.  Consequently, the collector will free such resources,
only for problems to arise when accessed through the non-collector heap's
pointers.  To overcome this, the collector's allocation and de-allocation
routines must be used throughout a %Facsimile application.  For compatibility
with third-party code, these replacement routines mark memory as being
uncollectable so that they must still be freed using traditional, manual means.
(However, be aware that third-party libraries may still use their own explicit
memory allocation/de-allocation routines all the same.)
-# The Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector provides replacement C++ global
<code><strong>new</strong></code> and <code><strong>delete</strong></code>
operators.  Unfortunately, they pre-date the ISO/IEC C++ standard and do
not conform to accepted standards for new and delete.  For example, they do not
throw the <code>std::bad_alloc</code> exception if memory is exhausted
(preferring to return a 0 pointer instead).  Also, they do not allow a handler
to be specified for attempting to recover memory prior to throwing the
<code>std::bad_alloc</code> exception.  To overcome this problem, we have to
provide our own replacement global <code><strong>new</strong></code> and
<code><strong>delete</strong></code> operators.
-# Leak detection for the entire simulation applications becomes a possibility,
using tools provided by the Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector.

\note
The global <em>placement</em> <code><strong>new</strong></code> and
<code><strong>delete</strong></code> operators (both single and array forms)
cannot be replaced.  Typically, these operators are used to create objects
within existing memory.  Provided that this existing memory was claimed using
the collector's allocation routines, no problems should arise.  Otherwise,
avoid using placement <code><strong>new</strong></code> operators and/or
storing pointers to collectable objects within objects created via placement
<code><strong>new</strong></code>.

/**
Abstract base class for collectable classes.

Sub-class instances that are created on the free store, via the
<code><strong>new</strong></code> operator, are regarded as being
<em>collectable</em>.  All other, regular C++ class instances, including
sub-classes created on the stack, are regarded as being <em>uncollectable</em>;
such classes still need to have their resources manually recycled (or recycled
by the C++ compiler-generated code when it determines that an instance has gone
out of scope).

A collectable instance is classified as being either <em>accessible</em> or
<em>inaccessible</em>.  An accessible instance is one to which active pointers
exist within the program; the instance can still be accessed through these
active pointers.  By contrast, an inaccessible object has no active pointers to
it remaining, and can be safely collected and recycled.  The <em>collector</em>
automatically keeps track of which instances are inaccessible, and collects
objects as needed.

The benefits of using an automated collector are many:
- <em>Memory leaks</em>, a significant problem if they occur within a
simulation model, are are almost entirely eradicated.  A leak will result when 
memory that is no longer required is not freed, reducing available memory.
- Programmers are freed from the chore of determining when each instance can be
safely deleted, eliminating bugs resulting from accessing memory that was freed
prematurely (although see remark on this subject below).
- Improved code reliability and robustness.
- Potential for improved memory management, with reduced memory fragmentation.

You are strongly recommended to derive your own classes from
Facsimile::Collectable.

\remarks
The <code><strong>new []</strong></code> and <code><strong>delete
[]</strong></code> operators are forbidden for use when creating sub-class
objects.  Any attempt to create sub-class arrays using the <code><strong>new
[]</strong></code> operator will yield an exception.  The primary reason for
this is that it is currently not possible to have clean-up performed for all
members of an array when they are collected.  However, it is also poor C++
programming practice to create arrayed objects, instead of using an appropriate
collection (such as std::vector).

\par
It is strongly recommended that you do not use the
<code><strong>delete</strong></code> operator to manually free sub-class
instances; pointers to the deleted instance may still be held elsewhere in
your program, resulting in crashes or other unpredictable behavior when
de-referenced.  By not using the <code><strong>delete</strong></code> operator,
you will eliminate this class of bug.

\par
The behavior of sub-class virtual destructors changes subtlely compared with
regular, non-collectable classes.  Instance destruction, for an element created
on the free store via the <code><strong>new</strong></code> operator, will
occur at an unpredictable time, depending upon when the garbage collector
recognizes that the instance is no longer referenced.  In some cases, the
garbage collector may <em>never</em> collect an instance, leaving it available
for the duration of the program.  For this reason, you should use virtual
destructors solely to release any allocated resource (such as non-collectable
objects, file handles, etc.); do not schedule simulation events from with
destructors.

\par
Because virtual destructors will be invoked at times depending upon the state
of the program and the available memory, problems relating to the execution
time of virtual destructors are likely to be difficult to reproduce.

\note
This class is based upon the <code>gc</code> and <code>gc_cleanup</code>
classes, developed by John R Ellis and Jesse Hull, that are supplied with the
<em>Boehm-Demers-Weiser</em> conservative collector currently used by
%Facsimile.  However, the <code><strong>new</strong></code> operators defined
in that class have non-standard behavior, in that they return 0 (or
<code>NULL</code>), rather than throwing a <code>std::bad_alloc</code>
exception, in the event that insufficient contiguous free store memory is
available.  They also make no reference to the standard <em>new handler</em>
feature.  Furthermore, the <code>gc</code> and <code>gc_cleanup</code> classes
are defined in the global namespace, which is not a desirable feature of the
%Facsimile library.  The Facsimile::Collectable class corrects these
deficiencies, allowing for collectable sub-class memory management, whilst
maintaining similar (if simplified) functionality.  Some additional features of
the <em>Boehm-Demers-Weiser</em> collector have also been incorporated.

collector is used to build the library (that is, if the <code>GC_DEBUG</em>
