/**
A reader for text data streams.

This class simplifies the parsing of text streams by reading the next field
(delimited as specified) from the stream and returning it as the required data
type (or throwing an exception if the field cannot be converted successfully).

Furthermore, this reader harmonizes line termination sequences, so that all
lines appear to terminate with a ''line feed'' character
('\n')&mdash;regardless of the actual line termination sequence.  (Typically,
''Windows'', ''DOS'' and ''OS/2'' text streams terminate lines with a
''carriage return'' character followed by a ''line feed'' character ("\r\n");
''Unix'' and ''Unix''-like systems, such as ''Linux'', ''Mac OS'' (versions X
and higher) and the ''BSD'' variants, terminate with a single ''line feed''
character ('\n'); older Mac OS systems (9 and earlier) terminate with a single
''carriage return'' character ('\r').  This reader, and its sub-classes, allow
all text streams to be treated as though they come from a ''Unix''-like system.

@todo Implement support for comments (ignore remainder of line, whole of line).

@todo Implement support for quoted fields (such as those in CSV files).

@constructor Constructs a new reader from a reader sequence.

@param reader Reader from which data is to be read.

@param defaultDelimiter Default set of characters and associated rules for
delimiting fields.  This delimiter is used if an explicit delimiter is not
passed to each field read operation.

@throws java.lang.NullPointerException if reader is null.
